We're a group of friends looking to solve some fun problems in our free time outside of work and school. 
Our experience ranges from data analysis all the way to the low level world of the resistor. 
Along with this, we're commited to open source software and hardware. As such we plan to release our designs 
and software as we solve each problem so that anyone can build and use them. This, we hope, will give us the 
impact we desire and ultimately will just be good old fun. We've been working in our free time and we 
will continue to do so, so stay tuned for updates.
